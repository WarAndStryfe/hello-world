Hello Planet Earth,
  I just joined GitHub to assist some people creating a mod for Crusader Kings III. 
  I enjoy Strategy and Role-playing games.  Final Fantasy VII is my favorite all-time RPG. 
  Anime is one of my favorite types of shows. I have seen Hunter x Hunter, That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime, Berserk, and many others.
  I love both dogs and cats, but cats are definitely my favorite.  I have had a Russian blue named Misty for 22 years. Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes would have to be my favorite dog breeds.
